# Pyhton-Project
People who keeps most of the files/folders at one location and get confused what all files are there and surely he/she is too lazy to do it manually. So this is a python program to organize everything in appropriate folder in a single go. Just save the program in the folder where all the files/folders are located and my program will segregate each file type into their respective folders
